Sensapp-Acceptance v0.1 
(C) 2014 - SINTEF ICT

  SensApp acceptance wraps a series of JUnit4 tests that verifies that
  a given deployment of SensApp is operational.

  These tests are end-to-end tests and will interact with a SensApp
  instance through the network, and potentially through the browser. A
  complete run of the test suite may take several minutes.
